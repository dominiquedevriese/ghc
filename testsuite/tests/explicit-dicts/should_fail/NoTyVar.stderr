    • Explicit dictionary application to: ‘Ord Int’
      is not allowed because of possible incoherence:
        There is a global instance for ‘Ord Int’
        Through an ancestor: There is a global instance for ‘Eq Int’
    • In the expression: maxInt ((absOrd :: Ord Int))
      In an equation for ‘maxAbsInt’:
          maxAbsInt = maxInt ((absOrd :: Ord Int))
